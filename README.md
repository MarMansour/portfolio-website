Give me a pencil and some papers, and you have me mesmerized forever. That was my childhood, sketching and drawing was subconscious, and I struggled to understand how people could not like to draw. I was always envisioning how things can look, and how that look can be adapted.

My dad is extremely passionate about restaurants, and he would think of the restaurant that he would want to open. He had a great grasp of the operations, of a restaurant but not so much how it would look. That’s where I would shine! I began collaborating with my dad, coming up with meaningful names, colour palettes, different type treatments. This was all intuitive, I didn’t know what a colour palette was, or the difference between a typeface and a font, I just felt that it looked good, and that it worked.

Collaboration and creation have been ingrained in me for some time. It is that marriage between the two that has bred my passion for graphic design. Being able to communicate ideas, feelings, and thoughts through visuals for a wide variety of industries is why graphic design is my career.
